description: MVP dev principle: break freely, restart locally

## Local MVP rules (break freely)

- **No backward compatibility required**. It’s OK to break APIs/schemas and refactor aggressively.
- Assume the user can restart backend/frontend and reset local state at any time.
- Prefer the simplest working approach over compatibility layers/migrations.

## Code size & professionalism (keep files small)

- Avoid generating or growing **large files**. Prefer small, composable modules.
- **Hard cap**: if a file would exceed ~300 lines, refactor/split it (extract hooks, helpers, components, types).
- **Soft cap**: aim for <200 lines per file for new code.
- Route/page files should mostly compose existing pieces; heavy logic belongs in `use*` hooks or `lib/*`.

## Backlog-driven development

- Treat `BACKLOG.md` as the source of truth for priorities: tackle items in order unless the user explicitly reprioritizes.
- Keep `BACKLOG.md` concise: one bullet per item, up to 3 sub-bullets; create/extend `backlog/*.md` detail files as needed.

## Cursor rules: how to use + when to update

- This repo uses multiple small rule files under `.cursor/rules/`:
  - `.cursor/rules/workflow`: validation commands + semantics of `fix`/`lint`/`types`
  - `.cursor/rules/frontend`: frontend guardrails (scoped to `frontend/**/*`)
  - `.cursor/rules/backend`: backend guardrails (scoped to `backend/**/*`)
  - `.cursor/rules/backlog`: backlog formatting + maintenance
  - `.cursor/rules/meta`: how rule files should look and when to change them
- Update/extend rules only when the assistant keeps repeating mistakes or when architecture/workflow changes materially. See `.cursor/rules/meta`.

## Response footer requirement

- At the end of **every** assistant answer, include a `Rules:` footer listing the rule files used as **rule names only** (no path, no `.mdc` suffix), separated by `, `.
