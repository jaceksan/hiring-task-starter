## Rule hygiene (keep rules effective)

- Keep rules **concise** and **high-signal**. Prefer checklists over prose.
- Only add/extend rules when:
  - the assistant repeatedly makes the same mistake, or
  - a significant design/architecture/workflow change lands (new scenario strategy, new engine, new test strategy).
- Avoid duplicating information across rule files; put shared guidance in `general` or `workflow`.
- When rules grow, **split** by concern rather than adding sections indefinitely.
- If a rule is meant for a specific area, scope it via `globs` (e.g. `frontend/**/*`, `backend/**/*`) rather than keeping it always-on.
