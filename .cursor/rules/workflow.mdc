## Default local validation loop (fast)

- Don’t start/stop dev servers unless explicitly asked; assume the developer runs them.
- After making changes, prefer:
  - `make fix-all`
  - `make types-all`
- Do **not** run `make lint-*` targets by default. Only run lint/verification targets if the user explicitly asks or when debugging a failing CI check.
- Do **not** push by default. Prefer:
  - implement → commit → ask the user to manually test
  - apply fixups as new commits if issues are found
  - push only when the user explicitly asks
- If the user asks to push and there are multiple fixup commits **not yet pushed**, autosquash them into a clean history before pushing.

## Tests (only when relevant)

- If backend logic changed: `make test-backend`
- If UI/API/map behavior changed: `make test-e2e-frontend`
