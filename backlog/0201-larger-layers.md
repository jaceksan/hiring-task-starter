## Larger layers for the largest scenario

### Goal

Keep the same “water + places” use case, but use larger datasets (if available) to make the largest scenario more realistic.

### Notes

- Prefer simple swaps: larger water bodies + larger places dataset for CZ/region.
- Update the `scenarios/czech_population_infrastructure_large/scenario.yaml` layer sources accordingly.
- Re-measure worst-case refresh + payload sizes (telemetry + network payload).
